# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, and important patterns and preferences for the sales platform project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Initial setup of Memory Bank documentation.
- Understanding the existing Laravel/React/Inertia.js codebase.

## Recent Changes:
- Created `memory-bank` directory.
- Populated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps:
- Create `activeContext.md` (this file) and `progress.md`.
- Review existing codebase to identify areas for improvement or new feature implementation based on the project brief.
- Address any immediate issues or errors identified by the linter/TypeScript.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Documentation First:** Prioritizing comprehensive documentation to ensure project understanding and continuity.
- **Error Resolution:** Need to address the TypeScript and ESLint errors in `resources/js/pages/Admin/Quotations/Create.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/Admin/Inventories/Create.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/Admin/Inventories/Edit.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/Admin/Quotations/Edit.tsx`, and `resources/js/pages/Admin/Sales/Create.tsx`. These errors indicate potential type mismatches or unused variables that need to be resolved for code quality and functionality.

## Important Patterns and Preferences:
- Adherence to Laravel and React best practices.
- Emphasis on type safety using TypeScript.
- Consistent use of Shadcn UI components where applicable.
- Clean code and maintainability.

## Learnings and Project Insights:
- The project uses a standard Laravel-Inertia-React stack, which is well-documented and widely supported.
- Spatie Permission is a key component for access control.
- Image handling is asynchronous, indicating a focus on performance.
- There are existing TypeScript errors that need to be addressed to ensure the stability and correctness of the frontend.
