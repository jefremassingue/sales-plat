# Progress

This document tracks the current status of the project, what has been built, what remains, and any known issues or evolving decisions.

## What Works:
- **Basic Project Structure:** Laravel backend with React/Inertia.js frontend is set up.
- **Database Migrations:** Many database tables are defined via migrations (e.g., users, products, sales, quotations, inventory).
- **Eloquent Models:** Corresponding Eloquent models exist for various entities.
- **Controllers:** Admin controllers are in place for managing different resources.
- **Frontend Pages/Components:** Several React pages and components exist for admin panels (e.g., Products, Quotations, Sales, Inventories, Categories, Blog).
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Spatie Laravel Permission is integrated for roles and permissions.
- **Image Handling:** A job for image resizing is present.

## What's Left to Build:
- **Full Feature Implementation:** Many existing pages/components likely require further development to meet all business requirements (e.g., complete CRUD functionality, advanced filtering, reporting).
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, feature, and end-to-end tests need to be developed or expanded.
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Robust error handling and client-side/server-side validation across all forms.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Continuous improvement of the user interface and experience.
- **Performance Optimization:** Further optimization for large datasets and high traffic.
- **Deployment Automation:** Setting up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

## Current Status:
- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created.
- **Frontend Errors:** Several TypeScript and ESLint errors are present in key frontend files (`resources/js/pages/Admin/Quotations/Create.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/Admin/Inventories/Create.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/Admin/Inventories/Edit.tsx`, `resources/js/pages/Admin/Quotations/Edit.tsx`, and `resources/js/pages/Admin/Sales/Create.tsx`). These need immediate attention.

## Known Issues:
- TypeScript and ESLint errors in various frontend files, indicating potential type mismatches, unused variables, or incorrect usage of form libraries. These issues need to be resolved to ensure code quality and prevent runtime errors.
- The `BreadcrumbItem` type is not exported from `@/types`, causing a TypeScript error.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:
- Initial focus on establishing a solid foundation with core modules.
- Future decisions will be driven by user feedback, performance metrics, and evolving business needs.
- Prioritization of bug fixes and stability before new feature development.
